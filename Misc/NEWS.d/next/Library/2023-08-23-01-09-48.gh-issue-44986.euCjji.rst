Added feature to argparse so that percentage symbols (%) don't have to be
escaped in help messages. Without this fix, they have to be escaped (as
stated in the documentation) but if you forget this, the error message that
is produced is completely cryptic. With this patch, 1) this does not happen
anymore, 2) single % don't need to be escaped and 3) it remains fully
compatible with the previous implementation.
