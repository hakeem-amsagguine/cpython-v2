Added support for multi-threaded XZ compression by passing in new optional
parameter ``threads`` into :mod:`lzma` API. Supported both in the
:func:`lzma.compress()` function and :class:`lzma.LZMAFile` class.

This is supported by using the underlying ``lzma_stream_encoder_mt()`` API
provided by liblzma.
